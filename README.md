# bc-review

Program to help review motion alarms generated by Bluecherry DVR.

## Reason

I wrote this because reviewing alarms in Bluecherry is a pain. The web UI is awful. The client is bitty and behaves terribly on OS X. Until it's better, this program allows you to pull down images into a directory for events between times. You can then use Finder or Windows Explorer or Nautilus or some other visual file browser to flick through the images to find ones that are of interest.

I find this quite an effective way at looking at a night's worth of CCTV events.

## How-To

    $ composer install
    $ ./bc-review review start-time end-time

`end-time` is optional, if it is omitted, the current time is used.

You can also review just one camera

    $ ./bc-review review 2016-05-01 2016-05-02 --camera 1

Or use shorthand dates:

    $ ./bc-review review yesterday today

Then review the downloaded images:

    $ open .cache
